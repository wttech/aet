## Documentation
AET has it's own [AET wiki](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki) containing:
- user documentation,
- developer documentation,
- system administrator documentation,
- system architecture documentation.

Current wiki content contains the information that is up-to-date with the AET `master` branch codebase.
If a user wants to refer to the older AET version documentation, there are dedicated one-page documentations 
[released together with AET code](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation#generating-released-version-documentation)
e.g. [AET 2.0.0 Documentation](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/Documentation-2.0.0).

By the design GitHub Wiki is a [separate git repository](https://help.github.com/articles/adding-and-editing-wiki-pages-locally/).
To make it easier to update documentation together with new features or fixes, AET keep all the documentation is in the same repository as the codebase, in the [documentation](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation) module.

After the feature branch (codebase and wiki pages) is merged to AET `master` branch - 
wiki repository is synchronised with the content of [documentation](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation) module
(this is manual action).

### How to contribute to AET documentation
When updating documentation please create new markdown page or update existing one in the
[documentation](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation) module following
[instructions](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation#writing-documentation).
Remember to include any updates together with any code changes in pull request.

Have in mind few important rules:
- When you add a new markdown page, add a reference to the [`_Sidebar.md`](https://github.com/wttech/aet/blob/master/documentation/src/main/wiki/_Sidebar.md)
file which defines how the Wiki's right navigation menu looks like.
- Please do not update wiki pages directly because your changes will be lost during the next wiki upgrade.
- If you spot some misspell (typo) remember that you can propose an improvement [directly from the browser](https://help.github.com/articles/editing-files-in-your-repository/).
Please do so, we believe that having good an up-to-date documentation is as important as having stable code.
- AET has its [FAQ](https://github.com/wttech/aet/wiki/FAQ). If you believe that something is missing there, please create a pull request or a [new GitHub issue](https://github.com/wttech/aet/issues/new).

## Changelog
When changing or fixing some important part of AET, please remember to update [Changelog](https://github.com/wttech/aet/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md).
Your entry should be enlisted **at the end** of the `Unreleased` section. It will be moved to appropriate release notes during release process.
Please use convention `- [PR-ABC](https://github.com/wttech/aet/pull/ABC) - short description of the PR.`.

## Tests naming convention
Tests written in AET should be named with `methodName_whenStateUnderTest_expectBehavior` convention proposed as the first example in [7 Popular Unit Test Naming Conventions](https://dzone.com/articles/7-popular-unit-test-naming).

### Examples:
**Unit tests**
`canTakeScreenshot_whenNoUrlProvided_expectNoUrlException`

**Integration tests**
In integration tests method name is omitted, and test class name should suggest what part of system we test:
`whenPageReturned404_expectNoScreenshotCollected`

## Coding Conventions

We follow Google code style guide for [JAVA](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html), [JavaScript](https://google.github.io/styleguide/jsguide.html) and [HTML](https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html) files.

We also follow [John Papa Angular style guide](https://github.com/johnpapa/angular-styleguide/tree/master/a1).

Below is a short list of things that will help us keep AET quality and accept pull requests:
- Follow Google Style Guide code formatting from AET Github (originally adapted from [Google Style Guide](https://github.com/google/styleguide))
  - [Google Style Guide for Eclipse](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/eclipse-java-google-style.xml)
  - [Google Style Guide for IntelliJ](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/intellij-java-google-style.xml)
- write tests (integration/functional and Unit Tests) following defined convention,
- write javadoc, especially for interfaces and abstract methods,
- update [documentation](https://github.com/wttech/aet/tree/master/documentation) and include changes in the same pull request which modifies the code,
- provide description of any new features,
- when logging use proper levels: `INFO` and `WARNING` should log only very important messages.
